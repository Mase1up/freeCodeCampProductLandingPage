# freeCodeCampProductLandingPage

Going to start with my normal pseudo-code.  Then let's see what special things they want to be used like sections or asides, and whatnot.  I'm guessing I have to build this one with grid, and I'm going to have to read a lot, even after doing the last project.

Have to use a header for the top fixed nav-bar

11-Sep-23
    I'm pretty happy that I have the media queries functioning the way I want them to.  Cool to see the layout actually act responsively.

    Okay, I made the header position fixed, and it stopped behaving as a block item.  Now the main-content is underneath it, and I can't get it to move down.....  

    I also added a .page-wrapper to try and force everything to flex, but that didn't seem to do anything at all.  May want to remove that.

    Fixed nav-bar current solution:
        I manually tested different margin pixel values to push the main content box down to where it ought to be.  Not really the solution I'd want to use, but it works for now.

    Using form for input and all that:
        I definitely don't remember the correct way to set any of this up.  I had the button laid out below, but then saw the requirement the button is inside the form, and couldn't figure out how to move it to a new line once it was in there.  I also don't recall how to submit to the proper URL, I tried entering src="" with the URL but I don't think that's correct.

    Got the video embedded.  YouTube makes it very easy (Share -> Embed) and it copies the HTML code.

    Left off after setting the headings for the Pricing section.

    Finished everything, and have it working in a way I'm happy with.  Time to test it and see what is working or not.  I would like to refine it a bit, but the tests that fCC wants make me care more about meeting those than aesthetics and functionality.
